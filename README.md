I just stepped in the world of computer programming last year by taking grade 11 introduction of Computer Science.
So far, the two languages that I knew are: Turing and Pascal.
For the future aspirations, I don't plan to go too deep in computer programming as programmers.
I believe that creates any imaginary programs that you like, and the sense of accomplishment afterwards are the best things I like in programming.
On another side, fixxing bugs is the part that I really feel anxious.
