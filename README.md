<br />I just stepped in the world of computer programming last year by taking grade 11 introduction of Computer Science.
<br />So far, the two languages that I knew are: Turing and Pascal.
<br />For the future aspirations, I don't plan to go too deep in computer programming as programmers.
<br />I believe that creates any imaginary programs that you like, and the sense of accomplishment afterwards are the best things I like in programming.
<br />On another side, fixxing bugs is the part that I really feel anxious.
